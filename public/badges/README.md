# Badge Images

This directory contains badge images for the badge generator system.

Badge images should be named: `badge-{city-slug}.png`

For example:
- `badge-singapore.png`
- `badge-jurong-east.png`

## Badge Specifications

- Size: 150px x 60px (or similar rectangular format)
- Format: PNG with transparent background
- Design elements:
  - Humble Halal logo or icon
  - Text: "Listed on Humble Halal"
  - Optional: City name
  - Colors matching brand

## Fallback

If a city-specific badge doesn't exist, the system will fall back to a generic badge or placeholder.

## Generating Badges

You can:
1. Pre-generate badges for all cities using a design tool (Canva/Figma)
2. Use a script to generate badges dynamically
3. Use a single universal badge for all cities
